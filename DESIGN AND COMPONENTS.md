This section details our design choices (making reference to our roadmap). Discussed is the component lists and the choice behind the selection.Add to it how you see fit.

1. INA219.
   
This is one of the compulsory components. According to JLCPCB we have a choice between INA219AIDCNR and INA219AIDR. This was after eliminating the more expensive or rare components. This component is **extended** hence will incure an added cost to use. From my analysis i would choice the INA219AIDCNR since it is cheaper and its datasheet implies that it has the same functionality as its counterpart. Additionally, the component is smaller compared to INA219AIDR hence helps with abiding to the space constraints.

Conclusion, we can go with INA219AIDCNR (datasheet linked) which is 0.6$ (net charge of 1.2$ for the board)
